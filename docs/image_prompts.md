# Exercise Illustration Prompts

AI image generation prompts for all 60 progression step illustrations.
Each step has two formats: **square** (`_sq`) for thumbnails and **landscape** (`_ls`) for the detail-sheet banner.

## Style Guide

All images share the same global style. The generator script prepends this automatically:

```
Minimalist calisthenics exercise illustration for a fitness app.
Smooth, slightly volumetric white figure with subtle grey shading on a solid
deep-charcoal background (#1C1C1C). No rounded corners, no border, no frame,
no vignette. Orange (#FF5722) curved motion arrows with arrowheads showing
movement direction; orange accent stripe or glow on the primary working
muscles or joints. Simple flat light-grey structural prop only when essential
(wall face, horizontal bar, or thin floor line). No face details, no text,
no labels. Bold, high-contrast, vector-render style.
```

Square (`_sq`) images use a **1:1** aspect ratio with the figure centred and
filling ~70 % of the canvas.
Landscape (`_ls`) images use a **16:9** aspect ratio with the figure centred
and generous dark negative space on the sides.
